# Prework - *Color Me*

Submitted by: Funmi Olukanmi

**Color Me** is an app that allows you to set up an introduction page with your name, school, and career interests. There's a button labeled "Switch" that changes the color of the background and name of the person each time it is pressed. It becomes representative of the ways we add color to our lives and hold the power to change the color we give off at any moment.

Time spent: **1.5** hours spent in total
